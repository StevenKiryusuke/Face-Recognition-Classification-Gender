# üß™ Project Description 
     
This project use a Face Classification that requires Male and Female gender. This project use CelebA dataset sources with 5000 sample dataset which can be used for basic classification especially on Image Processing learning curve. This Project used VGG16, ResNet50, and GoogleNet method of Face Recognition.  

# üõ† Project Modeling 

From this training model, it used the Parameters based on this below:

Then it trained with each of 3 seperate method in each notebook so it divided and we can conclude the model comparison below.

# üìà Project Evaluation 

Here's the result of using the VGG16, RESNET 50, and GoogleNET Comparison accuracy.

From this evaluation metric in the table. We can conclude that using GoogleNet will make accurately predict the right gender classification based on data. However, it needs extra time and manage the epochs first so the model will be running quickly and efficiently. 

# üìù Project Closing

For this project, we use VGGNET, ResNet, and GoogleNet to predict the gender classification based on the face. However, it stills need improvement of Data processing and running time model to measure the model efficiently and accurately.
